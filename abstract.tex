This report describes the main functionalities of \toolname
(\tooldesc) toolsuite. \toolname is designed to work with Java
bytecode such that no source code is required to perform its
activities. It is composed by a coverage analysis tool, by a
slicing tool, and by a complexity metric's measure tool. The
coverage tool can be used to assess the quality of a given test
set or to generate test set based on different control-flow and
data-flow testing criteria. The slicing tool can be used to
identify fault-prone regions in the code, being useful for
debugging and also for program understanding. The complexity
metric's measure tool can be used to identify the complexity and
the size of each class under testing, based on static information.
A simple example that simulates the behavior of a vending machine
is used to illustrate such tools.
